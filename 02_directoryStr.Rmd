# Folder organization

In general your files on your computer should be organized in some way that helps you find things.
One thing that many people find useful is to seperate their personal and professional files into two top level directories.
```
~
|- Personal
  |- Photos
  |- Money
     |- Taxes
     |- Reciepts
|- Professional
  |- 2020SpringClasses
     |- ComputationalMethods
     |- Notes
     |- Homework
        |- Homework01
     |- Labs
  |- OldClasses
```
If your files don't look like this that's ok. How you organize your computer is a very personal decision and you will probably change this multiple times over your life, but you should organize it in some way.

Directories like `Downloads` or `Temp` are designed for temporary storage and should not be a permanent home for your files.
Especially with `Temp` directories, your operating sytem or other programs on your computer could delete the files in these diretories to free up space!

For this class each assignment should be in it's own folder.
This assignment folder should be zip-ed and submitted as a single upload to the course website.
You should point a new Rproject session to that folder to ensure that the working directory of your Rmarkdown documents matches that of your Console.
Each assignment folder should have two daughter folders: `R/` and `data/`. All `*.R` files should go in the `R/` folder and all data files (typically `*.csv`) should go in the `data/` file.
Each assignment should have a single primary Rmarkdown document that should be located at the top level of the assignment folder as well as it's knit-ed html.

For example, homework 1's folder might look something like this:
```
Homework01
|-Homework01.html
|-Homework01.Rmd
|-Homework01.Rproj
|-data
  |-exampleData01.csv
  |-exampleData02.csv
|-R
  |-helloWorld.R
```
