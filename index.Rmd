# Why do we care about computational methods? {-}

Computational methods could be one of the most useful courses you have ever taken.
As an engineer, scientist or technical staff, you will probably have to collect and/or analyize data then use this to support decisions that will affect your clients and community.
The skills in this class will help you do this in a way that is transparent and reproducable. 

We are going to focus on two things this semester 1) data cleaning and visualization, and 2) developing numerical models.
Historically computational methods has focused on algorithms to solve numerical integration and optimization problems. 
We will do some of this over the course of the semester but in practice many of you will never actually need to write a forward-difference solver, instead relying on libraries and packages that are already developed.
This historically approach also ignores the new developments in data analysis workflows that have relatively recently come into common practice.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse) # clean up data and plot stuff in 04_tidyverse.Rmd
library(DiagrammeR) #draw box and flow diagrams in 10_models.Rmd
library(deSolve) #ODE solver for numerical models
```
